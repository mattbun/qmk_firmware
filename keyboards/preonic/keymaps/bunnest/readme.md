## Features

-   Inverted T arrow keys (had to move `/` elsewhere but it's worth it)
-   Three layers! You could fit everything in two but the extra layer makes it more intuitive and allows for a matching planck layout
    - `QWERTY` - contains every 60% key _except_ for `=` (and caps lock I guess but WHO USES THAT?)
    - `ESC` - accessed by holding escape, contains keys commonly used when typing (like `=` and `delete`) plus macros and media keys
    - `TAB` - accessed by holding tab, contains less commonly used "fun" keys like music mode, volume controls, and mouse keys
-   Enter acts like a right shift when held
-   Escape, tab, and enter are [mod-tap keys](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/mod_tap) but you can make them act normally if you hold escape (or tab)
